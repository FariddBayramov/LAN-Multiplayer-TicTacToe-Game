# üéÆ LAN Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **LAN Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game**! This project enables players to enjoy multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe over a secure local network (LAN) or through a wireless ad-hoc network. Built using **Python** and the **socket library**, it utilizes TCP/IP protocols to create a server-client architecture for real-time gaming.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Multiplayer Gameplay**
- Two players can connect over a LAN or ad-hoc wireless network to play Tic-Tac-Toe in real-time.
- Utilizes **TCP/IP protocols** to ensure smooth communication.

### 2. **Server-Client Architecture**
- A dedicated **server** is created to manage game connections.
- Players join a **room** by connecting to the server with a specified IP and port (3000).

### 3. **Localhost and LAN Support**
- Initially runs on **localhost** for testing and debugging purposes.
- Fully functional over a **local area network (LAN)** using tools like **Hamachi**.

### 4. **Reliable and Secure Communication**
- Communication between players is handled through the **socket library**.
- Port **3000** is used for secure and reliable data transmission.

### 5. **Cross-Network Connectivity**
- Players can connect from anywhere over an ad-hoc wireless network using Hamachi.

   ```

3. Run the **server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. Start the **client** for each player:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

5. Connect to the server using the IP address (via Hamachi or local network):
   - Server IP: `YOUR_LOCAL_IP`
   - Port: `3000`
